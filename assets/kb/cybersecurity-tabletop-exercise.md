## Scenario Background

MegaGuard Security Solutions is a well-established MSSP providing security monitoring and incident response services to over 50 clients across various industries. Among their key clients are:

- NexBank Financial (financial sector)
- MedCore Systems (healthcare)
- PowerGrid Utilities (critical infrastructure)
- TechNova Enterprises (technology)

MegaGuard uses a SOC platform that aggregates logs and alerts from client environments, with a centralized dashboard for monitoring and response.

## Exercise Narrative

A sophisticated threat actor has identified MegaGuard as a prime target for a supply chain attack. Their objective is to compromise MegaGuard's infrastructure to gain access to high-value clients. The attack will unfold in multiple stages over the course of the exercise.
